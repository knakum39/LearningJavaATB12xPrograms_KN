        Playable instrument;

        // Assign Guitar object

        instrument.play();  // Output: Playing Guitar

        // Assign Piano object

    }
}


//âœ… Step-by-Step Explanation:
//        1. Declaration of Interface Reference

//Playable instrument;
//You declare a variable instrument of type interface Playable.
//This variable can hold any object that implements Playable, like Guitar or Piano.

//        2. Assign a Guitar Object
//        instrument = new Guitar();
//Now, instrument refers to a Guitar object.
//Even though the reference is of type Playable, Java will call the Guitar classâ€™s play() method.

//instrument.play();  // Output: Playing Guitar

//3. Assign a Piano Object
//        instrument = new Piano();
//You reassign instrument to a Piano object.
//
//        Again, Java uses dynamic method dispatch to call the correct play() implementation from Piano.
//instrument.play();  // Output: Playing Piano
//ðŸ’¡ Why This Is Polymorphism:
//One interface reference (Playable instrument) is used to call different method implementations at runtime.
//Java decides which method to run based on the actual object (Guitar or Piano), not the reference type.
